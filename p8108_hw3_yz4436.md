### Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8108_hw3_yz4436_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>%
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart %>%
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>%
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
  spread(key = order_dow, value = mean_hour) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

### Problem 2

Import and tidy the dateset accel_data.csv. I create a variable
weekday_vs_weekend to indicate the day is weekday(Mon-Fri) or
weekend(Sat-Sun), then I relocate weekday_vs_weekend after variable day.
Finally, I use pivot_longer to write from activity_1 to activity_1440
into variable Activity_list, and values to Activity_datavalues.

``` r
accel_data_df =
  read_csv(
    "data/accel_data.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = day,
    weekday_vs_weekend = recode(weekday_vs_weekend, "Monday" = "Weekday", 
                                "Tuesday" = "Weekday", "Wednesday" = "Weekday", 
                                "Thursday" = "Weekday", "Friday" = "Weekday", 
                                "Saturday" = "Weekend", "Sunday" = "Weekend")
  ) %>%
  relocate(week, day_id, day, weekday_vs_weekend) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "Activity_list", 
    values_to = "Activity_datavalues")
```

-   Description about the resulting dataset:
    -   The number of variables in the resulting dateset accel_data_df
        is 6, which are week, day_id, day, weekday_vs_weekend,
        Activity_list, Activity_datavalues.
-   The number of observations in the resulting dataset combine_tidy is
    50400.

I aggregate across minutes to create a total_activity variable for each
day, and create a table showing these totals.

``` r
accel_data_df %>%
  group_by(week, day_id, day) %>%
  summarize(total_activity = sum(Activity_datavalues)) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'week', 'day_id'. You can override using
    ## the `.groups` argument.

-   I do not see any trends apparent based on the table that showing
    totals.

Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses
for each day and use color to indicate day of the week.

``` r
accel_data_df %>%
  separate(Activity_list, into = c("Activity", "minute"), sep = "_") %>%
  mutate(
    minute = as.numeric(minute)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = minute, y = Activity_datavalues, color = day)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .5) + labs(y = "activity counts", title = "24-hour activity time courses for each day") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) + 
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(0, 1440, 60), 
    limits = c(0, 1440))
```

\* Based on this graph, we could find that there is no specific pattern.
Also, the highest value appears around 1140 to 1200 minutes, which is
7pm to 8pm, and the lowest value appears around 0 to 240 minutes, which
is 0am to 4am.
